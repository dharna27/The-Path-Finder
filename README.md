# The-Path-Finder
This is a simple Java program that will take information (name) of the source and the destination from the user and display the fare and shortest route to reach the destination.
The idea is implemented using Graph and Heap data structures. The graph has nodes and edges. By using different algorithms like Dijkstra, breadth-first search, depth-first search, etc, the shortest path between the source and the destination is determined.
